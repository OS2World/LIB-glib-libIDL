   glib and libIDL for OS/2 Mozilla builds
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This combination of glib/libIDL was originally put together by Mike Kaply
(mkaply@us.ibm.com) and Henry Sobotka (sobotka@axess.com) and is meant to
be used together with the instructions at
   http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/OS/2_Build_Prerequisites
to compile Mozilla products on OS/2. Some files still contain references
to VACPP but now only GCC based compilation is supported (version 3.2.2 and
3.3.5).


- Setting it up
To install just unpack and make sure that the paths are reflected correctly
in your setmozenv.cmd.


- Recompiling for new compiler version
The package contains binaries for GCC 3.2.2 beta4 CSD1 (i.e. dependent on
libc05.dll) and GCC 3.3.5 CSD2 (libc062.dll), in the directories gcc322 and
gcc335, respectively. If you want to compile the two libraries in this package
with a new GCC version, please follow these steps:
   cd glib-1.2.10
   <edit Makefile and adapt PREFIX>
   make install
   cd ..\libIDL-0.6.4
   <edit Makefile and adapt PREFIX>
   make install
   <edit your setmozenv.cmd to reflect the new paths if needed>


- Sources
The sources are included in the glib-1.2.10 and libIDL-0.6.4 directories. They
come from the original Linux packages of the same version but have most files
removed that are not essential for our purposes (Win32 files, files only needed
for autotools-based build, and documentation).


- License
Usage is licensed under the GNU Library GPL (see COPYING for details).


- Contact
If you want to complain please post to the group mozilla.dev.ports.os2 on the
newsserver news.mozilla.org.
